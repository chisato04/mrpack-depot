## üíª Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PHP (no external libraries required)
- **Frontend:** Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)

## üöÄ Requirements & Installation

You'll need a local or remote web server with PHP support.

- A server environment like [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) (Windows), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Cross-platform), or a standard Linux server with Nginx/Apache and PHP.
- PHP 7.4 or higher.

**To set up the project:**

1.  **Clone the repository** into your web server's public directory (e.g., `C:/laragon/www/mrpack-depot`).
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chisato04/mrpack-depot.git
    ```
2.  **Create required directories:** Inside the project folder, make sure these two directories exist (they should be included in the repo with a `.gitkeep` file):
    - `/modpacks/` - This is where you will upload your `.mrpack` files.
    - `/modlists/` - This is where the associated mod list `.html` files will be stored.
3.  **Set permissions (if on Linux):** Ensure your web server has permission to write to the `modpacks`, `modlists`, and `metadata.json` files.
    ```bash
    # Example for a typical Linux setup
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .
    sudo chmod -R 775 modpacks modlists metadata.json
    ```
4.  **Access the site:**
    - Navigate to your project's URL (e.g., `http://your-repo-name.test`).
    - Access the admin panel at `http://your-repo-name.test/admin.php`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  Go to the **Admin Panel** (`/admin.php`).
2.  Use the "Upload New Modpack" section to add your `.mrpack` files.
3.  The page will refresh, showing your new pack in the "Manage Existing Modpacks" table.
4.  Fill in the **Mod Loader** and **Version** for the pack.
5.  Drag-and-drop the corresponding mod list `.html` file (exported from Prism Launcher) onto the "Modlist HTML" drop zone.
6.  Click **"Save All Changes"**.
7.  Go back to the main site to see your new modpack in the browser!
